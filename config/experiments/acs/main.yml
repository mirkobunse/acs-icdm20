#
# Sequential class-conditional data acquisition with heuristics. This experiment
# generates the test set performances of the natural class proportions used in
# Fig. 3 of our paper.
#

# general settings
seed: 876            # seed of the random number generator
verbose: 0           # verbosity of the logging
sequential: False    # whether experiments are run sequentially or concurrently
n_trials: 1000       # number of times each experiment is run
frac_test: 0.33      # fraction of test examples
proportional_test_set: True # whether the test set is proportional or uniform

classifier:
  class_name: ParzenWindowClassifier # custom implementation
  parameters:
    bandwidth: 0.05 # bandwidth of the Gaussian kernel

# fixed settings:
# - each feature is normalized to the unit range
# - the output path is set by a runtime argument
